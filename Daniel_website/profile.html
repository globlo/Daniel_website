      <h2>Daniel Valle was born in Santa Ana, California and raised in Brownsville, Texas at a young age. His grandparents greatly impacted his musical inclination as he saw them singing and playing  the guitar and piano at church in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. On his 14th Christmas, Daniel got his first electric guitar that his mom purchased with a lot of effort after constant supplication. Soon after he would team up with his childhood drummer friend to start a band which served to set the standard towards his lifelong musical journey. At the age of 18 he moved to Houston, Texas to continue his musical prowess and soon found himself performing on the streets and bars of his local community. At the age of 23 his creativity reached a plateau which led him to join the Houston Community College to pursue his Associate of Arts in Music, and this is where it all got started. Daniel began to unleash his creativity once again after engulfing himself in Music Theory, Ear Training/Sight Singing, Piano Studies and joining the Jazz ensemble. He also began taking private lesson’s in Music Composition, Jazz/Classical Guitar and Improvisation with some of Houston’s finest musicians. 

        Daniel Valle has now been teaching and tutoring for over 3 years, his experience ranges from studies in Classical/Jazz music, to singing/playing Rock/Blues/Gospel and even Songwriting. He has taught students from  the ages of 4 all the way to 60+ years of age. He is currently pursuing his Bachelor’s degree at the University of Houston’s Moores School of Music in Composition, and continues to learn and study every musical instrument he can get his hands on. He is currently working on his book ‘Master Any Instrument’ which consists of his successful methodical teachings on the Art of Music. </h2>
